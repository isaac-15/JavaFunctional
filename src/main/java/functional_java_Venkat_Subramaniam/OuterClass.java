     * In java you can define a class within another class, such classes are called "nested classes"
     *  - Scope of a nested class is bounded to its enclosing class, thus a nested class cannot exist independently
     *  - Nested class has access of all member vars(class vars), but the outer class does not have access to the member
     *      vars in the nested class
     *  - A nested class is also a member of its enclosing class
